# Description

In a rootless jailbreak environment, you might encounter errors while attempting to access app container folders, even when running SSH as a root user. This issue arises due to the binaries lacking the necessary entitlements.

# Usage

## Modify with ldid

1. For exemple, you can place the `entitlements.xml` file in the following directory: `/var/mobile/Documents/`

2. To modify `ls` binary, run the following command:

```shell
ldid -S/var/mobile/Documents/entitlements.xml /var/jb/usr/bin/ls
```

3. To modify `bash` binary, run this command:
   
```shell
ldid -S/var/mobile/Documents/entitlements.xml /var/jb/usr/bin/bash
```
## Download modified

Alternatively, you can download pre-modified binaries from the 'Releases' section and then place them in `\var/mobile/Documents/`.
